# ewd-installers: Pre-built automated installers for creating working EWDS.js systems
 
This repository contains installers for creating ready-to-run EWD.js systems.  They are ideal for anyone
new to EWD.js who wants to quickly discover how it works etc.  They are also a great way to quickly get a
working system up and running that you can then adapt and customise.

The installers are for use with Linux systems, virtual machines or Amazon EC2 instances.

The installers included are as follows:

- globalsdb: creates a GlobalsDB-based EWD.js system
- gtm: creates a GT.M-based EWD.js system
- dEWDrop: upgrades a dEWDrop Virtual Machine to an EWD.js-based environment

With thanks to David Wicksell for amendments to dEWDrop Upgrade Script
